<p>
Google has confirmed that more than <strong>40% of all Android phones are now at risk from new malware and spyware attacks</strong>, leaving well over a billion users vulnerable to cyber threats. This comes after the release of the latest Android distribution data showing a slow spread of the newest OS versions across devices worldwide. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
</p>

<h2>Why So Many Phones Are Vulnerable</h2>
<p>
The fundamental issue stems from fragmentation in the Android ecosystem. Unlike platforms such as iOS where Apple controls hardware and software updates, Android updates must pass through Google, device manufacturers (such as Samsung, Xiaomi, and Motorola), and carriers before reaching users. This multi-stage process often delays important security patches or prevents them entirely on older devices. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
</p>

<p>
According to the data collected in December 2025, Android 16 — the latest version — was installed on only approximately <strong>7.5% of devices</strong>. Android 15 had around 19.3% adoption, Android 14 had 17.9%, and Android 13 was on about 13.9% of phones. Only these four versions currently receive full security updates. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
</p>

<h2>Fragmentation and Security Update Challenges</h2>
<p>
Android’s openness has helped it become the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, powering billions of smartphones and tablets. However, this openness is also a security challenge. Multiple manufacturers customize their versions of Android, which means Google’s updates must be re-tested and modified by each brand — a process that delays delivery or stops updates altogether on many older devices. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
</p>

<p>
An example of Android security issues in history includes vulnerabilities like the Stagefright bug, which exploited a core media processing library and affected many phones before patches could be widely distributed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
</p>

<h2>Real-World Consequences</h2>
<p>
Because Android 12 and earlier versions no longer receive critical security patches, devices running those versions are permanently exposed to new malware, spyware, keyloggers, and data theft attacks. Even phones that technically support newer OS versions often receive updates months after they are released, if at all. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
</p>

<h2>What Users Should Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Check your Android version:</strong> Go to Settings → About Phone → Android Version.</li>
  <li><strong>Update regularly:</strong> Install updates as soon as they are available.</li>
  <li><strong>Use security apps:</strong> Good mobile security apps can provide an extra layer of defense.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider upgrading:</strong> Phones that can’t update to Android 13 or newer should be replaced for safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Staying updated and aware of threats is crucial for mobile security. With threats constantly evolving, outdated devices become easier targets for cybercriminals and spyware operators. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
