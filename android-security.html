<p>
Google has issued a serious warning to Android users worldwide: more than 40% of Android devices are no longer protected against modern malware and spyware threats.
</p>

<h2>Why Are So Many Devices Vulnerable?</h2>

<p>
Android phones running versions older than Android 13 no longer receive full security updates. This leaves over a billion devices exposed to newly discovered vulnerabilities and active spyware campaigns.
</p>

<h2>Real-World Consequences</h2>

<p>
Security researchers confirm that attackers actively exploit outdated Android versions. These attacks can result in data theft, financial fraud, and unauthorized surveillance.
</p>

<h2>What Should Users Do?</h2>

<p>
Google strongly advises users to upgrade to phones that still receive security patches. Mid-range phones with guaranteed updates often provide better long-term security than older flagship models.
