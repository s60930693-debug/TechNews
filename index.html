    <h2>When Automation Breaks: Why Modern Networking Research Needs a New Workflow Paradigm</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine running a careful measurement study to understand how an application
      behaves under different network conditions. Or imagine generating labelled
      datasets for a supervised learning model, where ground-truth must be collected
      under tightly controlled environments. Everything is planned. Everything is
      scripted. Everything works.
    </p>

    <p>
      You log into Instagram. You scroll through several reels. You generate realistic
      video traffic. You observe how performance shifts as latency increases or
      bandwidth drops. The experiment runs smoothly. Results look promising.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you try again the next day. The login screen changes. A button moves.
      A consent dialog appears asynchronously. The automation freezes or fails
      entirely. The workflow collapses — not because the research question changed,
      but because the application did.
    </p>

    <h3>The Hidden Cost of Fragile Automation</h3>

    <p>
      This experience is familiar to anyone who has attempted real-world automation
      for networking research or data generation. Traditional browser automation
      frameworks depend on brittle scripts tied directly to UI elements. Even minor
      interface updates are enough to break them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agent-based approaches promise flexibility, but they introduce new challenges:
      high runtime cost, latency from LLM inference, and nondeterminism that undermines
      reproducibility across experimental runs.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Data Generation Needs a Rethink</h3>

    <p>
      High-quality data is foundational for congestion control evaluation, Quality of
      Experience inference, anomaly detection, and traffic classification. Fragile
      scripts and manually curated traces limit scalability and comparability across
      research environments.
    </p>

    <h3>A New Direction for Workflow Design</h3>

    <p>
      A sustainable solution requires separating workflow intent from execution,
      decoupling logic from UI specifics, and enabling deterministic execution even as
      applications evolve.
