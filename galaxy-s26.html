<p>
Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 lineup is already making headlines months before its official launch. Fresh leaks suggest European buyers—especially in France—could face some of the steepest price increases Samsung has introduced in recent years.
</p>

<h2>How Much More Will the Galaxy S26 Cost?</h2>

<p>
According to industry insiders, the Galaxy S26 Plus with 512GB storage may see a price increase of up to <strong>€180</strong> compared to the Galaxy S25+. Even the 256GB variant could become €100 more expensive, pushing flagship pricing into uncomfortable territory for many consumers.
</p>

<h2>Why Are Prices Increasing?</h2>

<p>
Experts point to rising component costs, advanced AI-powered features, longer software support commitments, and global economic pressures. Samsung is expected to introduce next-generation processors, improved camera AI, and deeper on-device machine learning.
</p>

<h2>Should Buyers Be Concerned?</h2>

<p>
If these leaks are accurate, the Galaxy S26 series may struggle against increasingly competitive Chinese manufacturers offering flagship-level specs at lower prices. However, Samsung’s brand value, software support, and ecosystem remain strong selling points.
</p>

<h2>Official Launch Timeline</h2>

<p>
Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S26 lineup around <strong>February 25, 2026</strong>. Until then, buyers may want to monitor official announcements or consider last-generation models for better value.
