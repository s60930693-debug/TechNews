<h1>Galaxy S26 Pricing Leaks: France Faces Steep Samsung "Tax"</h1>

<img src="chrome_UIuY2w4t6p.png" alt="Galaxy S26 leaks">

<p>
Samsung’s next flagship smartphone series — the <strong>Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra</strong> — is expected to launch on <strong>February 25, 2026</strong>, with official unveiling likely at the Galaxy Unpacked event. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
</p>

<h2>Pricing Leak Details in Europe</h2>
<p>
Recent leaks reveal that in France and other European countries, Galaxy S26 pricing may increase significantly compared with the previous generation. Rumored figures suggest around a €100 increase for the standard 256 GB model and up to €180 more for the 512 GB variant. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
</p>

<p>
One reason for this potential rise is that Samsung is now standardizing 256 GB as the base storage, eliminating lower-capacity configurations and pushing starting prices higher. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
</p>

<h2>Production Costs and Component Challenges</h2>
<p>
Reports indicate that rising production costs — especially in memory components like high-speed DRAM — have made pricing decisions difficult for Samsung. Some executives are even negotiating with suppliers to reduce costs amid global economic pressures. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

  <li>Improved camera systems with larger sensors and enhanced AI imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</li>
  <li>Enhanced display technologies like high-brightness OLED panels and possibly a “Privacy Display”. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}</li>
  <li>Advanced AI features and broader support for third-party AI services. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Launch Timeline and Market Expectations</h2>
<p>
Leaked information suggests that the Galaxy S26 series will debut at the Galaxy Unpacked event on February 25, 2026, with pre-orders opening shortly after and general availability in early March. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
</p>
